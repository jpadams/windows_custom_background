puppet-module-custom_script
===========================

Puppet module to demo one-off windows scripts

This module will change the background to the 
files/maxresdefault.jpg (requires you to 
log out/log back in on windows remote desktop, 
and have "draw desktop background" enabled in 
your RDP client. If you dont care about that
portion, the script will also make an "audit"
dir and insert a text file containing some 
information about the machine.
